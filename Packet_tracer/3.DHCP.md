## Question: Design a system for assigning IP address automatically to host on a network.


Answer :

To simulate the network, we have created a network structure as shown below. It consists of a 1841 Router which has connection with two network. The left side of the router(Fa0/0) is connected to the Switch1, which is further connected to a DHCP servers and a PC. We assign IP address of 192.168.2.1 to this interface. The IP address, subnet mask and default gateway  are configured in this servers as shown in the figure.

To enable DHCP, we have created two pool in the DHCP server: serverPool and opposite Pool. In the serverPool, we have given the address of default gateway as 192.168.2.1. The start IP address for this pool is configured to 192.168.2.4. Similarly, in the oppositePool we have configured start IP address to 192.168.1.2 and default gateway to 192.168.1.1 as shown in the figure below.

Now, on enabling DHCP in th PC0 we got the result as shown below.

Similarly, on PC2 we got the result as shown below.
