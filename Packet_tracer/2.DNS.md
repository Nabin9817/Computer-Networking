## Question: Design a system to name IP addresses.

Answer:


To simulate the network, we have created a network structure as shown below. It consists of a 1841 Router which has connection with two network. The left side of the router(Fa0/0) is connected to the Switch1, which is further connected to two different servers and a PC. We assign IP address of 192.168.2.1 to this interface. The two different servers are DNS server and web server. The IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and address of DNS server is configured in these servers as shown in the figure.<br/>
Similarly, the IP address, subnet mask and default gateway and address of DNS is configured on all the end devices.

Now we have configured the DNS server. In the DNS option of services tab, we added the name of web as “yamprasad.com” and give the address to 192.168.2.4 which will map "yamprasad.com" to this IP. Similary, we mapped the PC3 with IP address 192.168.2.5 by the  name 'sushil' and PC0 with IP address 92.168.1.2 by name 'yam'.
The following figure shows the naming of the IP addresses.

On pinging PC0 from PC3 by name 'yam' gives the following result.

Similarly, on pinging PC3 from PC0 by name 'sushil' gives the following result.
