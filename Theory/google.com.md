# Q) What happens when you type google.com on the browser and hit enter?

### The Initiation: DNS Request

Our journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. The browser seeks to translate the human-friendly domain name www.google.com to an IP address, the language of computers. A query is sent to a DNS server, which acts like a phonebook for the internet, fetching the corresponding IP address for Google's server.

### The Protocol Suite: TCP/IP

With the IP address at hand, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) - the protocol suite - kicks in. TCP establishes a reliable connection between your machine and Google's server, ensuring data integrity and order. IP, on the other hand, is responsible for routing the data packets to the correct destination.

### The Guard: Firewall

Before the packets venture further, they encounter the firewall - a security system ensuring that only safe and authorized traffic is allowed through. The firewall scrutinizes the packets based on predefined rules before permitting them onward.

### The Secure Passage: HTTPS/SSL

As we tread into a secure domain (https), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensure a secure connection by encrypting the data transferred between your browser and Google's server, safeguarding against eavesdropping.

### The Distributor: Load Balancer

Arriving at Google's premises, a load balancer warmly welcomes the packets. Its job is to distribute incoming network traffic across several servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed with too much traffic. This way, it ensures a seamless user experience.

### The Frontman: Web Server

Post load balancing, the web server takes the stage, handling the HTTP request. It decides what action is needed, often communicating with an application server to process the request further.

### The Processor: Application Server

The application server is the brain behind the operation, executing the necessary business logic, interacting with the database, and preparing the HTTP response to be sent back to your browser.

### The Storer: Database

To fulfill your request, the application server might need to fetch or store data. It interacts with the database, where data is stored, retrieved, and managed, ensuring that your search query is successfully executed.

### The Grand Finale: Rendering

The HTTP response makes its way back through the channels, reaching your browser which then renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the webpage we all know and love as Google.
